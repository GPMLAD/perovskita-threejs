# Interactive Perovskite Drawing with Three.js

This project aims to create an interactive 3D scene representing a perovskite structure. The scene includes a blue sphere in the center, an octahedron with red faces and black edges, and a cube with green faces and black edges. Small red spheres are positioned at the vertices of the octahedron, and small green spheres at the vertices of the cube.
